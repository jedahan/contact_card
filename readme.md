this is how [I](jedahan.com) create contact cards

1. create base64 encoded, url-friendly uuid
_. link with long, obfuscated bookmarkable url
2. create matching qr code
_. submit images to moo.com
_. create matching route
_. overlay 'hack, jedahan, glider' over qr code
_. on first hit, create a unique long url
_. record each hit, geolocation + request object
_. show heat map of particular contact card
_. allow one uneditable comment per hit
_. if working with an augmented reality app, have the monster/flower grow based on how many times it has been passed along

front (centered):
  2 different qr codes, will cut

back (centered):
  scan
  share
   :D

issues/todo:
  only record true scans
    can a qr code link be POST only?
    just show another linked bookmarkable url after redirect?
